(Wanna hold on to this for you)

You laugh, I smile
Mirrors in thought, these fortunes we can share
And where there is dark, there are ghosts
Who give me hope

Wanna keep hold of this for you
Wanna keep hold of this for you

White love, this love
This powerful, this pure
Behind our eyes
And when I trip, when I fall
It's just like velvet

Wanna keep hold of this for you
Wanna keep hold of this for you

Where is the love?
